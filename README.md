ðŸŽ² Dice Roller App
Welcome to my first Flutter/Dart app!
This is a simple dice roller that displays a random die face (1â€“6) each time you press the Roll button. It uses Flutter for the UI and Dart for the logic.

ðŸ“± Features
Rolls a 6-sided die

Displays a matching image for each die face (1â€“6)

Clean and minimal UI

Great for learning Flutter basics like setState, Image, and button interaction
